# Module 2: Data Analytics & Visualization
## Overview
### Learning goals
- Examine role of visualization for data exploration and communication
- Understand and use key visual variables and design principles
- Assess plots for clarity, accuracy, and accessibility
- Select the right visualization types for different data and analytical questions
### Key terms and definitions
- Quantitative variable: Measured numerically and used for arithmetic comparisons, such as trip duration or temperature
- Qualitative variable: Represents categories or groups rather than numeric values, such as user type or station name
- Data frame: Structured table of data, observations of variables
Visual encoding: Mapping data variables to visual elements, such as position, size, shape, colour, or texture
- Visual variable: A graphical element that visually represents data values
- Perceptual rankings: A hierarchy of visual channels showing which encodings are easiest to interpret accurately for quantitative or qualitative data
- Chart components:: Supporting elements of a chart
- Relational plots: Visualizations that show relationships between two or more variables
- Bar charts: Display data using rectangular bars to compare quantities across categories, including grouped or stacked variations
- Area charts: Represent data values as filled areas under a line, often used to show cumulative or comparative trends over time
- Histograms: Divide data into bins to show distribution of a single quantitative variable
- Kernel density plots: Smooth estimates of a variable’s distribution, often used to compare patterns across subgroups
