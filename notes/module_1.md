# Module 1: Introduction to Urban Data Analytics
## Overview
### Learning Goals
- Describe what urban data is and explain why it is used to understand cities
- Identify and categorize common sources, formats, and types of urban data in real-world contexts, including the Canadian census
- Evaluate how choices in data collection, representation, and visualization introduce bias
### Assessment
- Identify a dataset, understand its structure, and consider how it could support analysis or storytelling
- Build the base for a final data story while practicing how to interpret data in context
### Recommended readings
- Introduction to urban data
- Measuring the city: metrics and indicators
- Subjectivity and objectivity in data 
### Terms and definitions
- Variable: Measurable attribute or characteristic
- Observation / record: Single unit of measurement in a dataset
- Dataset: Structured collection of related observations
- Metric / indicator: Summary measure used to describe or compare phenomena
  - Ex. Population density, average rent, vacancy rate
- Spatial unit: Defined geographic area used for organizing data
  - Ex. Census tract, neighbourhood, municipal boundary
- Open data: Data made publicly available
- Levels of measurement: Categories describing how variables are defined
  - Nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio
- Bias: Systematic favouring or exclusion of certain perspectives, groups, or outcomes in data collection, interpretation, or presentation
- Metadata: Information describing how data was collected, structured, and defined
- Data storytelling: Using data to communicate insights to support interpretation and action

## Key takeaways
Data is never a perfect reflection of reality. Many things influence what is and is not measured, such as institutional choices, resources, priorities, and power. Understand data within its historical and social context. 

Data visualization is concerned with:
- Exploration: Finding insights using data
- Communication: Presenting insights to others effectively and responsibly

The urban data storytelling framework has three parts:
1. Data analysis: What does the data tell us? What patterns or relationships matter?
2. Data visualization: How can this data be represented graphically to communicate insights?
3. Narrative: What story does the data tell? What is your argument or takeaway? Who is the target audience of your narrative?

Strong data story features
- Temporal or sequential framework
- Explanation or coherence between what happened and what could be
- Potential generalizability of the narrative
- Conventions typical to a story to grip the audience
- Moral tension that underlies the narrative, hopefully being resolved

The data analysis framework, though iterative and flexible:
1. Define the problem or question
2. Collect relevant data
3. Clean and prepare data
4. Explore and analyze data
5. Visualize data
6. Present findings

Common data sources: Designed/survey, administrative, crowdsourced, event-driven/real-time, derived

Common urban data types: Demographic, municipal, environment/health, land use and built environment, transportation, Indigenous communities, housing and homelessness, economy and commerce

Data formats are often tabular (spreadsheets, SQL) or hierarchical (dictionary-like, NoSQL).

Tabluar data can be in long format (tidy) or wide format. 
- Long format (tidy) has one row per observation
- Wide format has one row per targetted entity

Levels of measurement:
- Nominal: Categorical, no inherent order
- Ordinal: Categorical, ordered, no consistent spacing between values
- Interval: Continuous, equal spacing between values, zero is not "nothing"
- Ratio: Continuous, equal spacing between values, zero is "nothing"

Guiding framework for selecting urban data measures
1. What is the core question you are trying to answer?
2. What level of geography matters most?
3. Do you need change over time?
4. What is feasible based on available data?

Guiding questions for understanding data biases:
- What is being measured?
- Who is collecting the data?
- How is the data classified, analyzed, and visualized?
- What might have been missed?
